I am currently learning the C++ programming language and I would like to share some of my programs and exercises that I have worked on in class. As a beginner, I have been focusing on learning the basics of C++ syntax, data types, control structures, functions, and arrays.

I have written a few simple programs such as a calculator, a program to check if a number is even or odd, and a program to find the maximum and minimum values in an array. I have also completed exercises that involve creating functions to perform specific tasks such as calculating the area of a rectangle or finding the average of a set of numbers.

Although I am still new to C++, I am eager to continue learning and improving my programming skills. I hope to eventually be able to write more advanced programs and explore more complex topics such as object-oriented programming, data structures, and algorithms. I believe that with practice and persistence, I can become a skilled C++ programmer and create programs that are both useful and innovative.
